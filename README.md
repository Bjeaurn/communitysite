# Community Site
Simple site system for a basic community.

Requires/ideas:
- Users, maybe with a certain "Tag"
- Events
  - Public vs. Private events? Visible on calendar, but can't sign up?
  - Description, date, time, duration.
  - Attendance; yes, no, maybe.
  - Show attendance list.
- Chatbox
- Maybe simple plugin like TeamSpeak overview.
